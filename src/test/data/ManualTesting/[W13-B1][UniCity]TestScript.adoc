:sectnums:



== Introduction
This document explains how to perform manual testing on UniCity. It shows the command to type and the expected result.
Deatils on how to load the sample data is included as well.

[NOTE]
This is by no means an exhaustive list of tests.

== Instructions on how to load the sample data

[start=1]
. Add a folder called `data` to the same directory where the jar file is located.
. Copy the `[W13-B1][UniCity]SampleData.xml` file from IVLE into the data folder.
. Rename it `addressbook.xml`.

[NOTE]
A common mistake is renaming the file name as `addressbook.xml` making the entire file to be read as
`addressbook.xml.xml`. Make sure that the name is simply addressbook and the file type is xml.
