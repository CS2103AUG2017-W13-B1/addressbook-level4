== Introduction

UniCity is a desktop application that is mainly based on the usage of the Command Line Interface (CLI).
It aims to provide a user-friendly contact management experience for students to better manage their
ever increasing network.

This user guide comes with a reference for the user if he/she requires extra guidance and provides the following: +

[NOTE]
Familiarity with the CLI may be necessary to maximise the usefulness of UniCity.
